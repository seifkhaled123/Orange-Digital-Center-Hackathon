Act as a Senior Data Scientist and Technical Lead for a high-stakes Hackathon team. I need you to perform two major documentation tasks for this project.

### Task 1: Notebook Documentation
Analyze the Jupyter Notebooks in this codebase. For each notebook, I need you to generate professional Markdown cells to be inserted between code blocks.
* **Structure:** Use H1 (#) for Titles, H2 (##) for major sections (Data Ingestion, Transformation, Modeling), and H3 (###) for steps.
* **Content:** Explain the *business logic* and *analytical intent*, not just the syntax.
* **Math:** If you see financial calculations or statistical tests, write the formulas in LaTeX. Specifically, look for the "Present Worth" calculation we used to validate the dataset age.

### Task 2: Generate the Master README.md
Create a `README.md` file that presents this project as a complete "Data Forensics & Architecture" solution. Use the **Project Context** provided below to fill in the details. The README must be structured to impress judges.

**Use this specific "Project Context" to write the README:**
1.  **The Hook (Data Forensics):** We discovered the provided dataset was uncorrelated and outdated. We scraped fresh Airbnb data (Selenium) to compare.
2.  **The Math:** We mathematically proved the dataset was 8 years old using the Future Value formula: $F = P(1 + i)^n$ (where $i=10\%$, $n=8$). We used this to normalize the data.
3.  **Data Engineering:** We expanded the dataset from 20 columns to 36 columns (Feature Engineering).
4.  **Infrastructure:** We used Docker Compose to deploy a PostgreSQL database and pgAdmin.
5.  **Architecture:**
    * **Input:** Raw CSVs + Scraped Data.
    * **Process:** Python (Cleaning/Math) -> Docker/Postgres (Warehousing).
    * **Output:** Power BI (Business Intelligence) + Streamlit (User App).
6.  **Power BI Dashboard:** Mention that we denormalized the DB into 3 tables for Power BI and created 4 pages:
    * Overview
    * Distance Analysis (Geo-spatial)
    * Price Analysis (Elasticity)
    * C-Level Page (Business ROI & Expansion).
7.  **Tech Stack:** Python, Selenium, SQL, Docker, Power BI, Streamlit.

**Required README Structure:**
* **Title & Badge:** Project Name + "Hackathon Winner" vibe.
* **Executive Summary:** The story of how we fixed the "bad data" using math and scraping.
* **Architecture Diagram:** Use Mermaid.js syntax to visualize the flow (Scraping -> Math -> Postgres -> Power BI/Streamlit).
* **Key Features:** (Forensics, Engineering, Dashboard, App).
* **How to Run:** Instructions for `docker-compose up` and `streamlit run`.

Please generate the Markdown content for the Notebooks first, followed immediately by the full content for the `README.md`.
